Transformed and cleaned airline datasets in Power Query,
standardizing the data for visualization and analysis. I created
DAX measures to analyze passenger bookings, ticket statuses,
and flight performance metrics. I built interactive dashboards
with compact visuals for flight operations and customer insights.
Additionally, I configured relationships, slicers, and drill-
throughs, enabling dynamic analysis and real-time reporting via
Power BI Service.
